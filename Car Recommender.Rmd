How did we come to Car Recommender Project

Problem statement

The increasing demand of cars of local brands each year, with little to no source and app to look for the in-depth details inside the domain has quite made us felt intrigued in making our steps to producing this archive-recommender from websites with the aim to make it easier for users to look for their desired vehicle. 

The Questions?

What is the price range of the local car brands?

What is the car model with the highest price value in Malaysia?

Which year has most car model manufactured?

Objective

To identify the models available in Malaysia.
